# Features extraction on moles dataset
ICT for Health - ICT4SS @politecnicoditorino - 2019/2020

Moles are a common type of skin growth. They often appear as small, dark brown spots and occur when melanocytes, which give skin its natural color, grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. Moles generally appear during childhood and adolescence. Most people have 10 to 40 moles, some of which may change in appearance or fade away over time.
An individual mole is unlikely to become malignant (lifetime risk is about 1 in 3,000 to 10,000); however, patients with large numbers of benign moles (> about 50) have an increased risk of developing melanoma, a type of cancer.
Because moles are extremely common and melanomas are uncommon, precautionary removal is not justifiable. However, biopsy and histologic evaluation should be considered if moles have certain characteristics of concern (known as the ABCDEs of melanoma):

* **A**symmetry: asymmetric appearance;
* **B**orders: irregular borders (i.e. not round or oval);
* **C**olor: color variation within the mole or unusual color;
* **D**iameter: should be smaller than 6mm;
* **E**volution: new mole in a patient over 30 years or a changing mole.  

Periodical check of moles should be done in order to prevent the transformation in melanoma.
The **goal** of this project is to analyze a dataset consisting of images of moles and to **extract** two of the five features used for classifying moles: **border** and **asymmetry**. This kind of project are useful in **Tele-dermatology**, a subspecialty of dermatology and among the most popular application of e-health and telemedicine.

Finally, a **k-NN algorithm** is performed using the two features extracted to understand if these are sufficient to classify a mole.
